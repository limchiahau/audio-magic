# audio-magic
A service for managing audio devices for the Ubuntu operating system.

To build the app use gradle.

To run the app type the following command into the command line.
```
java -jar <path to jar file>.
```

Currently the program cannot be runned as a service. However that is coming in the near future. To work around that use this command 
```
watch java -jar <path to jar file>
```
